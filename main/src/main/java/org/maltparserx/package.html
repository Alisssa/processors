<body>
<p>Is the parent package of the entire MaltParser and contains the application class and a console engine of MaltParser.</p>
<p>SISTA: This is based on version 1.7.2 but it was modified for a better integration with our code:
    <ul>
    <li>The code was changed to work with liblinear 1.94 instead of 1.8.</li>
    <li>We changed the top package name to org.maltparserx to avoid collisions with the vanilla malt (this involved changes to Strings in *.java and appdata/, where classes were loaded by reflection).</li>
    <li>Made the code thread safe by creating a different OptionManager per thread and a few other small changes. Grep for "sista" to see changes in code.</li>
    <li>Modified ConfigurationDir so malt can load model files from a jar in the classpath (which happens for most users).</li>
    </ul>
</p>
